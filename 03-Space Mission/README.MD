Cascade 50 Cassette - Reboot

Game #03: Space Mission

This is a very basic BASIC game. It may well have been called 'how to die very easily in many different ways'. In terms of adventure it is quite lacking and very linear. There isn't really much advantage in converting this to assembly, but there is a lot of scope for enhancement.
