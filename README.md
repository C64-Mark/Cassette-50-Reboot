# Cassette-50-Reboot
A re-coding and redesign of the infamous Cascade 50 games cassette for the Commodore 64

Taking one game at a time, the plan is to initially recreate the games in assembly language with some tidying up of the graphics, and then to start to enhance and expand each game.

The end point should be a collection of 50 decent(ish) games for the Commodore 64.

All contributions welcome.
